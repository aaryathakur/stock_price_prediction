--> Project: Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning 

- Built an end-to-end ML pipeline for stock price forecasting using historical OHLCV data. 
- Implemented feature engineering (lag features, rolling means, volatility indicators). 
- Trained and compared multiple models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, SVR) with baseline. 
- Evaluated models with RMSE, MAE, R² → selected best performing model. 
- Applied feature importance analysis (Permutation Importance & RF FI) to interpret results. 
- Saved best model and metrics for reproducibility using joblib and json. 
- Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Joblib
